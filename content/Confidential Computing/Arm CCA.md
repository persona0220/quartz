Arm Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA) enables the creation of VM-based isolated execution environment. 

![[Pasted image 20240305150106.png]]
>[!note] Blue: GPC enforcement
- When CPU core accesses memory: access control checks by the **MMU**
- When [[PCIe]] device accesses host memory: **SMMU** perform access control
- CCA ensures that the GPCs on MMU and SMMU are in sync to reflect the latest state of access control rules at world granularity. 


##### Worlds
- Each core can program the access mode of physical address ranges to be root, realm, secure, or normal world. 

##### GPT
- **Granule protection table (GPT)** tracks which physical address belongs to which of the four worlds.
	- Maintained in the main memory, and belongs to the root world
	- Only the monitor can access and update them.

##### GPC
- All processing elements (cores, SMMU, caches, TLBs) are augmented with **Granule Protection Checks (GPC)**

##### Trusted firmware
- **Trusted firmware**, executing in the monitor, sets the world bit for the core when it performs a context switch. 

##### RMM
- **Realm Management Monitor** executes in the realm world at EL2.
- Ensures mutually distrusting realm VMs are isolated by managing stage-2 translations from guest physical address (IPA) to host physical address (PA)

##### Physical attack
- Bus-level encryption + integrity protection
- Cannot tamper data when it resides in the main memory

##### MPE 
- Memory Protection Engine encrypts data before storing and decrypts it on the way to the bus.
- Relies on MEC (Memory Encryption Contexts) extension which is a part of Arm CCA.
- Each realm VM is associated with a unique key.

## Workflow

### VM Creation
1. Hypervisor creates the realm VM
2. Trusted monitor updates the GPT to change memory pages from normal to realm world
	- [!] GPT changes trigger flushing of TLBs caches of all GPCs
3. RMM checks validity and updates its stage-2 translation tables
