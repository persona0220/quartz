### Attestation
Attestation is the process of demonstrating that software running in side TEEs on a remote computer is instantiated as expected. By using attestation, a remote party (tenant) can make sure that the application is running inside an authentic TEE, and it has not been tampered with. It's also the common way to establish trust between two TEEs.

### TEE

Examples are Intel TDX, [[Arm CCA]] and AMD SEV.

### TVM
TEE Virtual Machine. 

### TSM
TEE Security Manager

### TCB
