# TEE Device Interface Security Protocol (TDISP)

[TEE Device Interface Security Protocol (TDISP)](https://pcisig.com/tee-device-interface-security-protocol-tdisp)Â is a new framework and architecture to secure I/O virtualization.

- [c] If you wanted to ensure encryption in the past, it had to be done in a proprietary manner. Case in point, connecting Nvidia GPUs to AMD SEV VMs required cooperation from Nvidia, AMD, and Azure.
- [p] The TDISP framework standardizes the process and manages the entire key exchange, eliminating the need to build unique interfaces for each different device.

## Functions

1. Establishing a trust relationship between a TVM and a device
2. Securing the interconnect between the host and device.
	1. Detect register manipulation outside of TDISP
	2. Identify connection as no longer secure
	3. Flag the software
	4. Re-secure the link before the breach occurs.
3. Attach and detach a TDI in a trusted manner.

## Key management
1. Enables secure key exchange
2. Turn on and off the encryption, performing like a control panel, so you can refresh keys for the next hour
