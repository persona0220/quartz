- Most cloud deployments use PCIe to connect powerful CPU cores to dedicated accelerators
- Flexibility to plug in the best-suited devices after procurement
- Scalability to connect 16-64 devices per node.
- Bus-level access control mechanisms (Arm TrustZone, RISC-V PMP) do NOT extend to such devices

## IDE (Integrity and Data Encryption)
- PCIe-5 specification introduces IDE which provides **confidentiality** and **integrity** guarantees for PCIe packets.
- ==Hardware encryption== can be leveraged to build a performant design without software-based encryption.
	- [p] With device-accessible realm memory with HW encryption on both CPU and accelerators, it removes the need for multiple data copies and software-based encryption-decryption.
	- [!] Not designed for untrusted hypervisor
- each PCIe link per device has a unique key which is used for data protection.
