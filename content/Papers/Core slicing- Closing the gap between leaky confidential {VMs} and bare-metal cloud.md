# Observation
- Observed that typical cloud VMs run with a static allocation of memory and discrete cores, and increasingly rely on I/O offload.
- Cloud providers do not exploit the full complexity enabled by hypervisor-based virtual machines for IaaS workloads.
	- Core: VMs offered by major public cloud providers including Amazon and Azure are sized at core granularity and scheduled on distinct physical cores
	- Memory: the memory allocated to guest VMs is static; techniques such as memory ballooning or transparent page sharing are avoided
- cloud providers limit oversubscription to only their own (first-party) VMs or disable it entirely


# Goal
- Remove hypervisor from the trusted computing base. 
- Instead, run confidential VMs on bare metal hardware.
- Core slicing enables multiple untrusted guest OSes to run on shared bare-metal hardware.
- To ensure isolation without the complexity of virtualization, guests take ***static slice*** of a machine's cores, memory and virtual I/O devices.


- [p] Bare metal cloud servers can avoid hypervisor-level side channel attacks.
- [c] No virtualization. Cannot benefit from virtualization techniques.
